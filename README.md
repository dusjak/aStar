# A* algorithm

A-star algorithm for path finding in 2D space

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Installing

Python

```
Install Python (v.3)
```

Library

```
graphics.py (by John Zelle)
```

## Run

A*
```
Run A* algortihm with:  - fixed cell cost of "1": aStar1.py
                        - diverse cell cost: aStar2.py
```

Dijkstra and Breath First Search
```
Comment out parts of code to change the search algortihm. Explained in the code..
```

Boards
```
Change "filepath" to test other boards attached in the "boards" directory.
```
